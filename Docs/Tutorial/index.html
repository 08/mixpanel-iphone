<h1 id="logging_data_on_the_ios">Logging data on the iOS</h1>

<p>If you want to track user behavior on your iPhone\iPad application, first download the Mixpanel iOS API by cloning the git repository:</p>

<pre><code>git clone $REPO_LOCATION
</code></pre>

<p>or download the latest version from $DOWNLOAD_LOCATION and extract the files. The respository has two folders:</p>

<ol>
<li>MPLib - The Source code for the Mixpanel API and its dependencies</li>
<li>MixpanelEventSample - A sample application that tracks events using Mixpanel.</li>
<li>MixpanelFunnelSample - A sample application that tracks funnels using Mixpanel.</li>
<li>Docs - Documentation for the Project.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>

<p>Adding Mixpanel to your Xcode project is as easy as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the MPLib folder into your project. <img src="images/copy.png" alt="Copy Project" title=""></li>
<li>Check the &#8220;Copy items into destination Group&#8217;s folder&#8221; and select Recursively create groups for any added folders.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&#8217;s it.

<h1 id="initializing_mixpanel">Initializing Mixpanel</h1>

<p>The first thing you need to do in order to use Mixpanel is to initialize the <code>MixpanelAPI</code> object. We recommend doing this in <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching:</code> of <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</code> in your Application delegate. </p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {    
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPIWithToken:MIXPANEL_TOKEN];
    // Add the view controller's view to the window and display.
    [window addSubview:viewController.view];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="tracking_events">Tracking Events</h1>

<p>After initializing the MixpanelAPI object, you are ready to track events. This can be done with the following code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction) registerEvent:(id)sender {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel track:@"Player Create"];
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to add properties to the event you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction) registerEvent:(id)sender {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel track:@"Player Create" 
         properties:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[genderControl titleForSegmentAtIndex:genderControl.selectedSegmentIndex], @"gender",
                                                            [weaponControl titleForSegmentAtIndex:weaponControl.selectedSegmentIndex], @"weapon", nil]];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code snippet is taken from the MixpanelEventSample Project. Line 15-20 of the <code>MixpanelEventSampleViewController.m</code> file.</p>

<h1 id="tracking_funnels">Tracking Funnels</h1>

<p>Funnel analysis helps you increase conversions for any goal within your application. Here is how you would use them in your application. Lets say you have a button in your UI that launches a product list for your application. The first step would be something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) productViewLoaded {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel trackFunnel:@"In App Purchase" step:1 goal:@"Product List"];
    // product list code.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then there is a second step where a user launches more details for a specific product:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) selectProduct:(NSString*) product {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel trackFunnel:@"In App Purchase" 
                     step:2 
                     goal:@"View Product"
               properties:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:product forKey:@"product"]];
    // view product code.
}
</code></pre>

<p>The final step is where the user purchases your product:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) buyProduct:(NSString*) product {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel trackFunnel:@"In App Purchase" 
                     step:3 
                     goal:@"Buy Product"
               properties:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:product forKey:@"product"]];
    // buy product code.
}**
</code></pre>

<p>When viewing the Mixpanel Dashboard, you would see something like this. Please see the MixpanelFunnelSample project for the full source code.

<h2 id="registering_funnels">Registering Funnels</h2>

<p>If you want to track an event as a funnel step, you can register Funnels as follows:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {    

    // Override point for customization after application launch.  
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPIWithToken:@"YOUR_API_TOKEN"];
    NSArray *steps = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Product List", @"View Product", @"Buy Product", nil];
    [mixpanel registerFunnel:@"In App Purchase" steps:steps];
    // Add the view controller's view to the window and display.
    [window addSubview:viewController.view];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the code above would turn into the following:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) productViewLoaded {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel track:@"Product List"];
    // product list code.
}

-(void) selectProduct:(NSString*) product {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel track:@"View Product"
               properties:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:product forKey:@"product"]];
    // view product code.
}

-(void) buyProduct:(NSString*) product {
    MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
    [mixpanel track:@"Buy Product"
               properties:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:product forKey:@"product"]];
    // buy product code.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use the Funnel Builder, for more information on how to do this, please visit <a href="http://mixpanel.com/api/docs/guides/funnel-analysis">http://mixpanel.com/api/docs/guides/funnel-analysis</a></p>

<h1 id="super_properties">Super Properties</h1>

<p>Super properties are an easy way to store data about your users. They are global properties that get attached to everything you are tracking. More information can be found <a href="http://mixpanel.com/api/docs/guides/super-properties “super properties”">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to register a super property for your current user, you can do it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
[mixpanel registerSuperProperties:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"Paid" forKey:@"User Type"]
                        eventType:kMPLibEventTypeAll];
</code></pre>

<p>This call will register the &#8220;User Type&#8221; property with a value of @&#8221;Paid&#8221; for the current user on both events and funnels. The permitted values for the eventType parameter are:</p>

<pre><code>* kMPLibEventTypeAll: Attach the super property to events and funnels.
* kMPLibEventTypeEvent: Attach the super property to events.
* kMPLibEventTypeFunnel: Attach the super property to funnels.
</code></pre>

<p>If the &#8220;User Type&#8221; property was previously registered, its value will be overwritten. If you do not want to overwrite existing values of a super property you can use the following call:</p>

<pre><code>MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
[mixpanel registerSuperPropertiesOnce:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"Paid" forKey:@"User Type"]
                            eventType:kMPLibEventTypeAll];
</code></pre>

<p>After this call, the value of the &#8220;User Type&#8221; property will be written only if it did not exist. There is another flavor of <code>registerSuperPropertiesOnce:eventType</code> and it can be used as follows:</p>

<pre><code>MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
[mixpanel registerSuperPropertiesOnce:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"Paid" forKey:@"User Type"]
                            eventType:kMPLibEventTypeAll
                         defaultValue:@"Free"];
</code></pre>

<p>This call will write out the new value for the &#8220;User Type&#8221; property if it does not exist or if its current value is &#8220;Free&#8221;.</p>

<h1 id="identifying_a_user">Identifying a User</h1>

<p><code>MixpanelAPI</code> uses the UDID of the current device as its default identifier. You can easily change the identifier with the following call:</p>

<pre><code>MixpanelAPI *mixpanel = [MixpanelAPI sharedAPI];
[mixpanel identifyUser:username];
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>username</code> is an <code>NSString</code>. </p>
